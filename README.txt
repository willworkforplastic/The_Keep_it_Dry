THE KEEP IT DRY

Keeping your precious filament dry since yesterday!

These are the CAD and production files for a small passive dry box to keep 4 Diamond age 1Kg plastic 
spools dry while your tantillus 3D printer is not running. Probably will work for other spool types but
none tested at the time of writing this.

Refer to Keep it Dry.pdf for more detail and assembly notes.


Cheers
Will Work for Plastic 
(and Paintballs)
